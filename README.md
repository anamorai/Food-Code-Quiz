# Code Quiz

I was required to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores that allows a user to gauge their progress compared to their peers. My page runs in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. 

To complete this I will write a javascript code that will:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
* Present a series of prompts for password criteria
* Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

## Installation

To open the project please follow this link: https://anamorai.github.io/Javascript-Code-Quiz/

## Usage 

Once you open the URL, you will see the following:

By clicking on the 'Generate Password' button you will see a series of prompts. It will look like this:

## Features

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
* Questions contain buttons for each answer.
* When answer is clicked, the next question appears
* If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
* The quiz ends when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
* When the game ends, it displays their score and gives the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Credits

I would like to refrence my bootcamp course, EdX and my tutor Praktiko for the great lessons provided which gave me the skills necessary to be able to complete this project.
